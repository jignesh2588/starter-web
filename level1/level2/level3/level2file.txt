--branch <name>
Instead of pointing the newly created HEAD to the branch pointed to by the cloned repositoryâ€™s HEAD, point to <name> branch instead. In a non-bare repository, this is the branch that will be checked out. --branch can also take tags and detaches the HEAD at that commit in the resulting repository.

-u <upload-pack>
--upload-pack <upload-pack>
When given, and the repository to clone from is accessed via ssh, this specifies a non-default path for the command run on the other end.

--template=<template_directory>
Specify the directory from which templates will be used; (See the "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section of git-init(1).)

-c <key>=<value>
--config <key>=<value>
Set a configuration variable in the newly-created repository; this takes effect immediately after the repository is initialized, but before the remote history is fetched or any files checked out. The key is in the same format as expected by git-config(1) (e.g., core.eol=true). If multiple values are given for the same key, each value will be written to the config file. This makes it safe, for example, to add additional fetch refspecs to the origin remote.
